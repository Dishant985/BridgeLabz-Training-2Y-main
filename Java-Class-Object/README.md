# Best Programming Practices

1. Use meaningful class names (e.g., Student, Employee) and method names (e.g., displayDetails).
2. Encapsulate data using private fields and provide getter and setter methods.
3. Follow proper naming conventions (camelCase for attributes and methods).
4. Always provide constructors to initialize class attributes.
5. Use comments for clarity and better readability.
